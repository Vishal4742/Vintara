# ðŸš€ VINTARA PITCH PRESENTATION
**4-Minute Pitch Script for Aniket Sahu**

---

## ðŸ“‹ SLIDE 1: OPENING HOOK (30 seconds)
**[Show Vintara Logo & Hero Image]**

> "Hi, I'm Aniket Sahu, and I'm here to introduce **Vintara** - the first native Bitcoin DeFi protocol that lets you earn yield directly in Bitcoin, not wrapped tokens or IOUs, but actual Bitcoin.

> **The Problem**: Traditional DeFi forces Bitcoin holders to wrap their BTC, bridge to other chains, and accept counterparty risk. They lose Bitcoin's core value proposition: **security and trust**.

> **The Solution**: Vintara runs on Rootstock, Bitcoin's longest-running sidechain, giving you the security of Bitcoin's $500 billion hash power with the flexibility of DeFi."

---

## ðŸ“‹ SLIDE 2: THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY (30 seconds)
**[Show Market Statistics]**

> "Bitcoin holders control over $1.3 trillion in value, but less than 1% participates in DeFi due to:
> - Security concerns with bridges
> - Wrapped token risks  
> - Complex multi-chain processes

> This represents a **$13+ billion untapped market** of Bitcoin that wants to earn yield while staying secure.

> Vintara captures this market by being the **only protocol** where your Bitcoin stays Bitcoin while earning up to **15% APY**."
