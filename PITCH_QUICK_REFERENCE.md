## ⚡ BACKUP ANSWERS FOR Q&A

**Q: How is this different from wrapped Bitcoin?**
A: "Wrapped Bitcoin requires trust in centralized bridges and custodians. Vintara uses Rootstock's two-way peg, which is secured by Bitcoin miners themselves - no third-party risk."

**Q: What's your go-to-market strategy?**
A: "We're targeting Bitcoin maximalists first - they want yield but won't compromise on security. Then expanding to institutional Bitcoin holders who need compliant DeFi solutions."

**Q: How do you handle price volatility?**
A: "Our lending protocol uses dynamic interest rates and liquidation mechanisms. Plus, users earn yield in Bitcoin, so they're not exposed to additional token risks."

**Q: What's your token economics?**
A: "VINT tokens govern the protocol and accrue value through fee sharing. It's designed to align long-term incentives with Bitcoin holders."
